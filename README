This is a fork of MythTV created by David Matthews.

The fixes/0.27 branch is my "production" branch.  It includes a number of
my patches.  Other branches are either inherited from the original or
are branches of master designed for pull requests.

dvbt2support.  This branch contains code to support DVB-T2 on tuners that
do not auto-switch between DVB-T and DVB-T2.  It has been submitted as a
pull request and trac ticket (January 2015).
